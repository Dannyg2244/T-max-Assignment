        <h3>All You Need To know About Caffe Americano Coffee</h3>
        <p>Caff√® Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, 
            giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. <br>
            Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added.
